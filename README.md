# How to run the App 

- After cloning the repo, install all the dependencies or node packages used for development via Terminal using the command `npm install`.
- Create a separate .env file to connect and add the following as `key: value`.
  - PORT: 2121 (or any other port example: 3000)
  - DB_STRING: `your database URI`
    - Note: If Port doesn't work, change the port number to 5000.
- Make sure the .gitignore file lists .env 
- Then `npm start` and connect to your localhost to see the rendered server.
